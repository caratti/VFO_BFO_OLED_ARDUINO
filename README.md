<H2>About Si5351</H2> 

Arduino Library from Etherkit: https://github.com/etherkit/Si5351Arduino

Description:
"The Si5351 is an I2C configurable clock generator that is ideally suited for replacing crystals, crystal oscillators, VCXOs, phase-locked loops (PLLs), and fanout buffers in cost-sensitive applications. Based on a PLL/VCXO + high resolution MultiSynth fractional divider architecture, the Si5351 can generate any frequency up to 200 MHz on each of its outputs with 0 ppm error. Three versions of the Si5351 are available to meet a wide variety of applications. The Si5351A generates up to 8 free-running clocks using an internal oscillator for replacing crystals and crystal oscillators. The Si5351B adds an internal VCXO and provides the flexibility to replace both free-running clocks and synchronous clocks.....".
